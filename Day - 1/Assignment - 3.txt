Data types in JS : 

There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript:-

1. Number - For numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±2^53.
2. bigint - This is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
3. string - A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
4. Boolean - Used for logical operations i.e. for true/false.
5. Null -  null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
6. Undefined - Used for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
7. Object  - Used for more complex data structures.
8. Symbol - Used for unique identifiers.

According to the value, we could determine under which data type the value comes 
using the Typeof operator - 

The typeof operator returns the type of the argument. It’s useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quick check.

It supports two forms of syntax:

As an operator: typeof x.
As a function: typeof(x).

typeof 10n // "bigint"

typeof true // "boolean"

typeof "foo" // "string"
